<p>
    I am a Salesforce Administrator/Developer with a strong foundation built from real, hands-on experience across multiple
    industries, including government, nonprofit, and private-sector organizations. My journey began on the business side in
    sales and operations, where I personally implemented Salesforce to solve critical process challenges. That early
    initiative evolved into a full Salesforce career centered on process optimization, automation, integrations, Experience
    Cloud, and system architecture.
    
    Over the years, I’ve supported complex environments for the U.S. Navy, HomeFreeUSA, and previous organizations — leading
    integrations, building scalable solutions, optimizing user experiences, and partnering with leadership to translate
    business requirements into clean, effective Salesforce designs. I specialize in declarative automation, data management,
    user enablement, and cross-system connectivity, while also being comfortable extending functionality through Apex when
    needed.
    
    My background reflects initiative, resilience, and a commitment to continuous learning. I bring a problem-solver
    mindset, strong stakeholder engagement skills, and a drive to build systems that improve efficiency, data visibility,
    and overall business performance.
